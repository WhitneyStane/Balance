Making this D&D style. All attacks are based on rolls. Characters need to pass perception checks in order to notice things, etc.

I'll need to create characters for each important person. Will put that in another file.

Lekku, Montral body language

Statera's last name is Halcyon. Don't ever mention it in the story.

Statera needs a decent weakness.
-"Saving people thing"
	-Might be overused
	-make it a desire to be omnipotent
	-save everyone
-Regret instead?
-remembers every kill
	-tattoos it to his chest
		-names?
		-tallies?
		-something else?
		-combination would work
			-names of those where he knows them
			-tallies for those he doesn't know their names
				-tallies more painful for him
				-wants to know every person he killed
	-could be a subject for emotional breakdown
	-always hides it under clothes
		-master doesn't know?
			-might be best to let master know but be unable to help or act

Senate Dance: The Fall has a good point.
-Ahsoka is rather upbeat and fine for dealing with death quite often.
		-She may have nightmares or issues dealing with it.
		-could have her trick mind healers, it isn't that hard
		-have Statera help her out
				-Don't bring in mind healers. They aren't close enough to a person to help much.

Statera is still afraid inside.
-it's a driving force to learn about the Force
		-He'll be able to protect those he cares about and himself with the Force
				-That's why he doesn't give much of a shit about Dark Side and Light Side

Cool Force powers:

Phasing is a Force ability. (Do stuff with that after a while.)

Tarkin is an admiral in the clone wars.

Play with the Force Priestesses. They give a lot of interesting options. 
	-Toy with Statera
		-possibly have him not be the one who is truly tested.
		-most definitely have him not be tested
	-Statera probably is good friends with his dark side.
		-Don't reuse the same tests Yoda did
	-Moraband is Korriban, but the name has changed throughout history.
	-Statera knows it by its old name, Korriban.
	-He's been there before.
		-maybe have him never have visited, but knows quite well about it.
		-have him visit it
		-explore tombs
		-bring in a bunch of KoTOR elements, especially regarding Korriban
		-have him talk with dead Sith
			-then have fun with them

Don't like the original trilogy
	-best to save Anakin from becoming Darth Vader
		-but Vader still is a kick ass character...
	-probably want to continue on after the clone wars ends.
	-Statera and Ahsoka may want to head on their own instead of staying in the Order
	-do I want to keep Ahsoka in the order?
		-probably
		-maybe have Statera leave because of idealogical differences
-Bring in Centerpoint?
-Bring in Abeloth?

Jocasta Nu as a powerful Jedi. Just in case.

Mace Windu adopted Vaapad (a darkish side lightsaber form that channeled dark emotions into the fight). Make him understand the dark side plight of Jedi, but unable to understand why they would choose to use it. Or just make him nice and understand why Jedi would choose to use the dark side.

The Force is nature. The force doesn't want shit except for balance.

[Council members:
Adi Gallia
Eeth Koth
Shaak Ti
Obi-wan Kenobi
Kit Fisto
Anakin Skywalker (Apparently he wasn't on the counsel yet... Wait, plot hole. He was a master but not on the counsel, and in the movie he was on the counsel but not a master.... Gotta find a way to resolve that. I'm putting him on the council anyways. Fuck George Lucas.)

Plo Koon
Mace Windu
Yoda

Statera and Hett have the holocrons of Darth Nihilus, Darth Andeddu, and Darth Bane
