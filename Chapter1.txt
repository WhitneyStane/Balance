It was more than a decade ago.

She had first met the young human while they were both younglings. He was timid, nearly jumping at the mere rustle of a Jedi master's cloak.

It had taken time, but she and her best friend, Gir'rina, a Twi'lek, pulled him out of his shell. Within a few short weeks, Statera became as close to her as she was to Gir'rina.

They trained together, learning to commune with the Force from the great master Yoda. Their strength grew, each different from each other. Gir'rina's control over the Force was always gentle, a featherlight touch filled with kindness and compassion. She would become a very powerful healer, Master Yoda once told them.

Statera was not powerful in his own right, but his mind was sharper than most. He was quick to learn any lesson related to the Force and he devoured every story he could find of the old Jedi. His curiosity about the Force was a well documented fact, to the pride of some Jedi masters and the worry of others.

She, however, was a force to be reckoned with. Her skill with a saber was excellent for her age. Her connection to the Force would sing loudest in the midst of battle, even if those battles were simulations.

Over the years, they grew into their own niche, wielding the Force in their own way. As a group, they were strong, each relying on the other in the midst of training. When they were teamed up, no simulation could stand in their way. Statera's creativity giving them an edge in almost every situation. Rina's gentle spirit, calming them when they disagreed, quietly giving them strength. Her power, allowing her to obliterate their enemies, defending those she cared about.

Together, they were formidable, capable of equaling padawans several years their senior.

Apart, however, they were much more limited. Her recklessness often causing the mission to fail before it began, Gir'rina's gentle spirit prevented her from being a powerful warrior, Statera's apathy for everything but the Force leaving him unprepared for the more physical challenges.

Eventually, the time drew near for them to build their own lightsabers.

The journey to Ilum was never an easy one. The crystal caves would reveal their weaknesses on the path to building their lightsaber. She was unable to find her crystal for hours, her reckless attitude making her overlook subtle hints from the Force. Gir'rina never shared her story, and Statera had walked out of the caves unusually quiet and contemplative. 

Statera's crystals were unique, she later found out. They were not the pure crystals that most younglings would find. His were newly formed crystals, containing small impurities that other crystals did not. Many of the Jedi masters were worried about such a sign. Finding crystals with impurities was very, very rare. The last recorded time impure crystals were found was millennia ago, on the planet Dantooine, one of the rare, crystal growing planets outside the Ilum system. The last Jedi to possess impure crystals vanished from the Jedi Order. Many in the Order speculated the Jedi turned to the dark side. Others decided to hold their peace, since the records regarding that era were sparse and fragmented.

They soon learned the difference between the training sabers they were used to and a real lightsaber. [expand on this. This isn't very good.]

After a week or so, she asked Statera what he thought of his lightsaber. He told her he didn't care what the master's said. They didn't possess his lightsaber and the records were unclear about the other impure lightsabers. It was his saber and it was he who learned the secrets of the crystals, not the masters. As she questioned him further about the secrets, he had smiled and leaned in to tell her.

For the next few years, the trio trained together, becoming more powerful in the Force with each lesson. They grew closer to each other as well, their bond bring smiles to the faces of the more liberal Jedi masters and a significant amount of worry to the more conservative.

Things began to change as they grew older, she never tired of the training simulations, fighting enemy after enemy. Strategizing and executing maneuvers on the battlefield became her passion, one in which the Jedi masters commended. The clone wars were beginning to spread throughout the galaxy and her skills would be needed on the front lines, they said.

Statera never lost his hunger for knowledge regarding the Force, but he also saw the necessity of the other lessons. It became his new mission to apply the Force to all lessons he learned, sometimes making large leaps in experience, other times lagging far behind his peers. His research into the Force a constant thorn in the side of the masters, studies encompassing both the light side and the dark side alike.

Gir'rina spend more time in the infirmary, learning the healing potential of the Force. Her strength grew, her use of the Force accelerating the recovery of those around her. Her gentle countenance healing many warriors' battered spirit.

Growing into teenagers brought many more problems for Jedi than for the Force-insensitive folk. As Jedi, they swore away attractions and attachments, and yet, they were still plagued by them. The Jedi masters had long since resigned themselves to the fact that the budding Jedi would form small attachments to others as hormones would reshape their bodies into their adult form (some more drastically than others).

Twi'leks hit puberty earliest, commonly at the age of nine. She grew drastically, growing from just under a meter, to 1.8 meters tall in a couple short years.

She and Statera, however, hit puberty about the same time. As their bodies changed, so did their group dynamic.

Gir'rina, having gone through it before, watched her two companions as they adjusted, giggling at them as they went through similar experiences as she went through. She couldn't help notice how closely the two had become as they aged. She knew the attachments they were forming were against the Jedi Code, but she couldn't bring herself to stop them. If she ever looked back at her actions, she would realize how much that little inaction would affect the Jedi Order.
