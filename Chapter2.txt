It had been three years since Statera had left her the message. Ahsoka had finally received word that Statera and Master Hett were returning to the Temple on Coruscant.

Ecstatic, she raced to Gir'rina's room to tell her the news.

"Rina! Rina! He's on his way back!"

She had rushed through the door, nearly tripping over Gir'rina's small pile of datacubes.

"Rinaah!" She drawled out her name. "Watch where you put those things, I could have been hurt."

"Ahsoka, you wouldn't have run into them if you didn't rush through my door like a gundark was on your tail." Gir'rina didn't even glance toward Ahsoka as she looked at her holopad.

"Besides, you're a Jedi, you would have survived."

Ahsoka sat down on Gir'rina's bed. "Fine...but you'd need to nurse my ego back to health."

Gir'rina snorted. "Your ego is so massive a mere fall wouldn't even make a dent." 

Finally, she put her holopad down, she turned to Ahsoka fully. "Now what is so important that you needed to interrupt my research again?" She said with a small smirk on her face.

Ahsoka brushed off her remark before answering. "Tera's on his way back!" She exclaimed.

Gir'rina's smirk disappeared as she looked at Ahsoka. "Truly? He's returned?"

Ahsoka beamed at her. "Yes, he should be here in a couple days."

Gir'rina sat down next to her. "This is truly wonderful, Ahsoka!" She said, smiling, as she thought back to the times they spent together.

Ahsoka laid back. "I wonder how much he's changed..." She said, slightly wistful.

"You just want to see how good he looks now." Gir'rina teased gently.

Ahsoka blushed slightly. "You don't have to say it out loud." She smacked Gir'rina's arm.

She and Gir'rina had spoken about Statera many times since he left. Her feelings for their friend had been brought up quite often as well.

She didn't know what those feelings were for Statera, even though she had years to introspect. Since he'd been gone for so long, she'd buried them away, even having a one-sided romance with Lux Bonteri.

His return would test her. But, at the moment, she was too excited to care.

--

A couple days later found her in the Temple hangar, watching a ship land and its two passengers disembark. 

Statera had changed quite a bit, she noted. His countenance was more confident and he had filled out quite nicely. But there was something different about him now. He felt different in the Force.

Her train of thought was interrupted when the two figures walked toward the small grouping of Jedi waiting for them.

Master Yoda, on his hover chain, moved forward, addressing Master Hett. "Much to discuss, have we. Withdraw to the Council Chamber, we will." The aged Jedi turned and began to hover toward the Jedi Temple.

Ahsoka watched as Statera's eyes traveled over the small group of Jedi, pausing as their eyes met.

"Quite outspoken, Master Yoda is." He said quietly to her, winking. She blinked at his sarcastic words. Scratch what she had said earlier, Statera had changed a lot. His younger self would never have joked about the diminutive, green Jedi so brazenly.

As they headed back to the Temple, he walked next to her. She looked up at him. He had grown quite a bit since he'd left.

Neither of them spoke, as they entered the Temple, following the unspoken customs of the Order. Padawans were not supposed to be disruptive in the presence of the Council. Eventually the novice Jedi learned that it meant to be quiet unless called upon. Most padawans also thought it was unfair.

She stepped slightly closer to him as they trekked up to the council chamber. The two padawans remained outside as the Masters entered the council chamber.

The door hissed shut, and the silence grew deafening.

Ahsoka wasn't quite sure what she was going to say when she found herself surrounded by a pair of wiry arms. Caught off guard by Statera's sudden action, she didn't react until after he'd released her.

"I missed you, Ahsoka." He said, smiling and stepping back. "And, damn, you've grown since I've left." He said, looking over her.

She smiled. "So have you, Tera. You actually look masculine for a change."

The look on Statera's face caused her to burst out in laughter.

Frowning, Statera looked away. "It was only one time." He muttered just loud enough for her to hear.

"And we'll never let you forget it." Ahsoka retorted.

Statera smiled at that. "And I still don't have dirt on you. That isn't quite fair, you know."



[Fill in. Ahsoka needs to ask about Statera's change in the Force.]



He sat down, looking decidedly less enthused. "Ahsoka, you're going to find that a lot of things have changed. I've seen some shit and done things I never would have dared when I was younger."

Ahsoka snorted. "Don't we all do that?" She was going to say more, but the look Statera gave her made her pause. "...what do you mean, Tera?" She said, a little more cautious.

He sighed as he looked away. "Not yet, Ahsoka. I don't speak about my past lightly."

She frowned, alarms going on in her mind. This was unlike him. He never used to- She caught herself. It had been three years. It may not have seemed like a huge amount of time to the Jedi Masters, but for teens, an immense amount of change could happen in three years.

She moved and sat down next to him. "All right, when you're ready. Besides, we all have secrets we hide."

Statera looked at her, with a half amused smirk on his face. "That was surprisingly mature of you, 'soka." He said, teasingly.

She punched his arm. "Just because you changed while you were gone doesn't mean that the rest of us stayed the same. And I will find out your secrets someday, Statera!"

Statera chuckled and leaned back against the wall. Silence overtaking them again. This time, it wasn't deafening. To Ahsoka, it seemed rather comfortable.

[In the council chamber]



--

As the council members left the room, either through the front door or the power button on their individual holocams, Statera stepped out of the room while his master turned to speak with Anakin and Mace Windu.

"Tera!" He turned to see an excited Togruta. He smiled, and walked over to her. 

"Ahsoka, you've grown a lot since I left." He said as he stepped closer and wrapped her into a hug. "I've missed you."

She was surprised at the hug, he could tell. A few moments later, her arms wrapped around him as well.

"Not that I'm complaining," She said as they stepped apart. "But I think the other masters don't like these displays of affection."

____I'm sure many of the masters would have deemed that against the Jedi code."

He gave her a huge grin, "Of course, I'd forgotten the Jedi Order's preference for solitude." He said in a very lighthearted voice.

He watched her frown, alarms going off in her mind.


[Do shit. Not sure what.]

A'Sharad Hett stood before the council, delivering his report. They found many Sith artifacts and lost knowledge, but nothing had been disturbed for many centuries. They found a potential trail on the edge of the Unknown Regions, but it grew cold in the Outer Rim. Even backtracking, they were lead to non-existent planets. 

The council were reminded of Kamino, but agreed with Master Hett's conclusion that it was because the Unknown Region wasn't studied well enough.

He spoke nothing about his padawan's research, though, at Statera's request. A'Sharad Hett couldn't deny his padawan once he understood Statera's reasoning, "It will be a lot more fun, Master."

_____He also brought up his padawan's research into the Force. Several of the masters voiced their disapproval until Master Yoda spoke up.

_____"Listen to his tale, we will, before judgement we pass." The masters still grumbled, but heeded the green Jedi's words.

_____Master Hett walked to his apprentice. "Remember, they may not understand, but if you can convince the youthful Masters, you may revolutionize the way we teach the Force."

_____Statera nodded before stepping in front of the Council.

_____"Masters, during our mission, we discovered many artifacts, both Sith and Jedi. Some artifacts even dated back to the pre-Republic eras.

_____"We also learned of many Force-wielding sects, such as the Matukai, the Je'daii from which our Order originated, and the well-known Voss Mystics. Some of these sects taught very different ideals than taught by the Order today.

_____[Include more stuff]

"Well, it looks like our two padawans didn't waste any time finding each other." A sarcastic voice said behind him.

Turning, he saw that Hett had finished his conversation with Anakin. "It would seem so, Master Anakin." A'Sharad Hett responded. "I do believe my padawan would like to move forward with what we have discussed."

"What did you ask of SkyGuy?" Ahsoka turned to Statera. Annoyingly, his grin hadn't disappeared.

"I asked Master Hett to set up a sparing match between Master Skywalker, Master Windu, and myself." He responded.

"Are you crazy? Master Windu is the best duelist in the Order! And Master Skywalker is no slouch either." She added at a lighthearted glare from Anakin.

"Than that will be their downfall. I do not duel." Was Statera's response.

"And what do you do?" She shot back at him.

He began walking down the hallway, heading toward the sparing arena several floors below. "I win." He said, glancing over his shoulder at her.

Rolling her eyes and ignoring A'Sharad's chuckles, she started after him.

"Shall we get a move on, then?" Anakin said, with an amused grin.

----

Ahsoka stood next to A'Sharad Hett as they waited for the three combatants to finish getting warmed up. She was rather worried about her newly returned friend, challenging two of the top duelists in the Order wasn't something to be done lightly.

"Aren't you at least concerned, Master Hett?" She asked the quiet Jedi.

"My padawan can take care of himself, Padawan Tano." Was the reply.

"But-" She started.

"My padawan can take care of himself." A'Sharad's words were slightly harder this time, but his face broke into a grin. "Besides, he has learned a few tricks while under my tutelage."

Not quite reassured, she looked back at her friend. He looked so calm as he stretched, not at all worried about the impending fight.

He finally stood and waited for the others to finish, casually glancing at them before looking over at Ahsoka. He grinned at her, which was surprisingly more reassuring than his Master's words had been.

Mace Windu and her master, Anakin, had taken up their lightsabers, waiting for confirmation for the duel to begin.

----

Statera looked at the two Jedi, studying them slightly before glancing at Ahsoka. She had grown much since his departure and it looked good on her.

Flashing a smile at her, he noted how much more powerful she felt in the Force. It shone through her, strongly but more far more gently than in the past. 

'She's gained more control over the Force. Skywalker must be good for her.' He thought.

As the other Jedi took up their lightsabers, he pulled himself back to the present. It was time to have fun.

"Master Skywalker, Master Windu. While I traveled the galaxy with Master Hett, we discovered many artifacts and techniques lost to the ages, many dating even back to the Old Republic. Today, you will learn how well you would fare against the Jedi of old." He said in a cocky tone. The tone wasn't completely forced, either. Statera knew his strengths and he was more than confident he could handle the two Jedi masters.

He ignited his lightsabers, a smile crossing his face as his opponents circled him. 

He'd taken to fighting with dual lightsabers after a particularity dangerous mission. With the additional training he received from the ancient holocrons found on his journey, the fighting with two lightsabers became as easy as fighting with one.

As one, Anakin and Windu rushed Statera from opposite sides. Splitting a fighter's attention was a good way to knock them off balance, ending fights in the early stages if the warriors were good.

The blue and purple lightsabers cut through nothing but air as the owners were flung across the arena.

"The first lesson I relearned was simple, remember the Force. Let it guide your blade." Statera said, quoting the words each Jedi was told as they first took up their training saber.

He went on the offensive. With blinding speed, he rushed at Anakin. His blades crackled loudly as they collided with Anakin's barely successful block.

Unfortunately, Anakin's luck ran out as Statera's lightsabers twisted with impossible speed, forcing his blade from his hand.

Immediately, Statera turned to meet Windu's attack, leaving Anakin wonder how he was disarmed.

"My second lesson. Use the Force." Statera said, making a small flicking motion toward Windu.

The bald Jedi master went flying backwards as a powerful wave of the Force, well, forced him off his feet.

Looking back at Anakin, Statera watched as the Jedi master cautiously circled him again. He smirked, recognizing what was occurring. The two Masters were reassessing him, treating him like an enemy rather than an impertinent youngling.

Mace Windu and Anakin Skywalker looked at each other for a split-second before attacking Statera again. This time, they no longer held back.

----

To say that the next moments of the fight were epic would be an understatement. To the observers, it quickly became obvious that, if Statera had taken on a single opponent, he would have been toying with the poor Jedi.

Ahsoka stared on in awe at her friend's abilities.

"You'll want to close your mouth, Padawan Tano. It is not becoming of a Jedi to gawk." A'Sharad's amused voice shook her out of her trance.

Blushing slightly, she responded. "I apologize, Master Hett. You were right, though, Tera's learned much. I shouldn't have doubted him."

A'Sharad chuckled at her words. "He's having fun right now. If he ever sheaths his lightsabers, that means he has taken the fight very seriously. I've seen him like that several times..." His voice trailed off as he thought back. Shaking his head slightly, he finished his sentence. "The outcome is never pretty."

Curious, Ahsoka tried probing. "What happened?"

A'Sharad shook his head again. "Now is not the time, Padawan Tano. It is something you should ask of him."

A'Sharad turned his attention back to the fight. His apprentice was now using some rather obscure uses of the Force. While using the Force to increase a Jedi's agility and reflexes was still common, it was a less effective than what the Jedi used one thousand years in the past.

Statera was dancing between the two masters, keeping the Jedi on the defensive. Even when they were able to get an attack, it was quickly countered by the young padawan. His movements were on the level of Master Yoda's, precise and quick.

He ended his assault by sending the two flying across the room.

"That was Force Speed. I found it to be more refined than the techniques taught today." He said as the two Jedi reengaged him. His voice had lost a bit of its arrogant tone.

He leapt back, simultaneously pushing the two masters away from him again. He made a quick descision and sped toward Windu, attacking him before leaping away.

Windu turned to attack Statera again but was forced to retreat as Anakin started to attack him.

"Skywalker, what are you doing?" He demanded, deflecting the assaults from his supposed ally.
