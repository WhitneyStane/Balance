"Hold up, I need to grab something from the ship." Statera said, soon after leaving Anakin behind.

Ahsoka stopped pulling him and gave him a questioning look.

Statera turned them toward a turbolift. "You'll see once we find Gir'rina. It's one of my 'secrets'." He said, in a rather loud stage whisper.

She merely rolled her eyes at him. "Fine, we'll make a quick stop."

They made their way quickly to the hangar bay.

Statera unlocked the ship and brought Ahsoka inside.

She looked around as he left to find whatever it was he needed.

The ship was rather plain, at least to her eyes. There wasn't much in the way of decoration and piles of holocubes could be found on random tables and even floors. A couple of piles even looked like they had a holocron mixed in with them.

She picked it up and looked it over, frowning as she felt darkness inside. The design was different from the Jedi holocrons she had used previously. A pyramid in shape, it had a multitude of deep red and black markings covering it.

Statera walked back in, carrying a small pack. "Ah, you found Nihilus' holocron."

Placing the holocron back, she turned to face him. "Nihilus?"

He nodded. "Darth Nihilus. He was a literal wound in the Force. Capable of consuming the Force from any living being."

She was silent for a few seconds before finally asking the question he half expected. "Then why the kriff do you have it lying out in the open?"

Statera merely smirked at her.

That facial expression was becoming less endearing by the second, Ahsoka thought.

Statera used the Force to pick up the Holocron and levitate it between them. A few seconds later, the holocron began to open.

The eerie visage of Darth Nihilus appeared before them. The Dark Side was palpable now, nearly overwhelming. The visage of Nihilus spoke, not in Basic, but still understandable through the Force, like all holocrons could.

Ahsoka felt sick from dark energy flowing from the holocron. She never realized she was retreating until her back hit the wall of the ship. She slowly felt better as Statera closed the holocron and placed it back among the holocubes.

"That is why we left it in the open, Ahsoka. The ability to open it is beyond most Jedi." He said. After a slight pause, he quietly added, "It takes the touch of the Dark Side to open Sith holocrons."

He ignored her questioning look and began to walk out of the ship. "We've got to meet Gir'rina, remember?"

Frowning at his avoidance, she followed him. Silently.

[They also have the holocrons of Darth Andeddu and Darth Bane]

_____"And what do you do?" She shot back at him.

_____He began walking down the hallway, heading toward the sparing arena several floors below. "I win." He said, glancing over his shoulder at her.
_____
_____Rolling her eyes and ignoring A'Sharad's chuckles, she started after him.

_____"Shall we get a move on, then?" Anakin said, with an amused grin.

Ahsoka stood next to A'Sharad Hett as they waited for the three combatants to finish getting warmed up. She was rather worried about her newly returned friend, challenging two of the top duelists in the Order wasn't something to be done lightly.

"Aren't you at least concerned, Master Hett?" She asked the quiet Jedi.

"My padawan can take care of himself, Padawan Tano." Was the reply.

"But-" She started.

"My padawan can take care of himself." A'Sharad's words were slightly harder this time, but his face broke into a grin. "Besides, he has learned a few tricks while under my tutelage."

Not quite reassured, she looked back at her friend. He looked so calm as he stretched, not at all worried about the impending fight.

He finally stood and waited for the others to finish, casually glancing at them before looking over at Ahsoka. He grinned at her, which was surprisingly more reassuring than his Master's words had been.

Mace Windu and her master, Anakin, had taken up their lightsabers, waiting for confirmation for the duel to begin.

----

Statera looked at the two Jedi, studying them slightly before glancing at Ahsoka. She had grown much since his departure and it looked good on her.

Flashing a smile at her, he noted how much more powerful she felt in the Force. It shone through her, strongly but more far more gently than in the past. 

'She's gained more control over the Force. Skywalker must be good for her.' He thought.

As the other Jedi took up their lightsabers, he pulled himself back to the present. It was time to have fun.

"Master Skywalker, Master Windu. While I traveled the galaxy with Master Hett, we discovered many artifacts and techniques lost to the ages, many dating even back to the Old Republic. Today, you will learn how well you would fare against the Jedi of old." He said in a cocky tone. The tone wasn't completely forced, either. Statera knew his strengths and he was more than confident he could handle the two Jedi masters.

He ignited his lightsabers, a smile crossing his face as his opponents circled him. 

He'd taken to fighting with dual lightsabers after a particularity dangerous mission. With the additional training he received from the ancient holocrons found on his journey, the fighting with two lightsabers became as easy as fighting with one.

As one, Anakin and Windu rushed Statera from opposite sides. Splitting a fighter's attention was a good way to knock them off balance, ending fights in the early stages if the warriors were good.

The blue and purple lightsabers cut through nothing but air as the owners were flung across the arena.

"The first lesson I relearned was simple, remember the Force. Let it guide your blade." Statera said, quoting the words each Jedi was told as they first took up their training saber.

He went on the offensive. With blinding speed, he rushed at Anakin. His blades crackled loudly as they collided with Anakin's barely successful block.

Unfortunately, Anakin's luck ran out as Statera's lightsabers twisted with impossible speed, forcing his blade from his hand.

Immediately, Statera turned to meet Windu's attack, leaving Anakin wonder how he was disarmed.

"My second lesson. Use the Force." Statera said, making a small flicking motion toward Windu.

The bald Jedi master went flying backwards as a powerful wave of the Force, well, forced him off his feet.

Looking back at Anakin, Statera watched as the Jedi master cautiously circled him again. He smirked, recognizing what was occurring. The two Masters were reassessing him, treating him like an enemy rather than an impertinent youngling.

Mace Windu and Anakin Skywalker looked at each other for a split-second before attacking Statera again. This time, they no longer held back.

----

To say that the next moments of the fight were epic would be an understatement. To the observers, it quickly became obvious that, if Statera had taken on a single opponent, he would have been toying with the poor Jedi.

Ahsoka stared on in awe at her friend's abilities.

"You'll want to close your mouth, Padawan Tano. It is not becoming of a Jedi to gawk." A'Sharad's amused voice shook her out of her trance.

Blushing slightly, she responded. "I apologize, Master Hett. You were right, though, Tera's learned much. I shouldn't have doubted him."

A'Sharad chuckled at her words. "He's having fun right now. If he ever sheaths his lightsabers, that means he has taken the fight very seriously. I've seen him like that several times..." His voice trailed off as he thought back. Shaking his head slightly, he finished his sentence. "The outcome is never pretty."

Curious, Ahsoka tried probing. "What happened?"

A'Sharad shook his head again. "Now is not the time, Padawan Tano. It is something you should ask of him."

A'Sharad turned his attention back to the fight. His apprentice was now using some rather obscure uses of the Force. While using the Force to increase a Jedi's agility and reflexes was still common, it was a less effective than what the Jedi used one thousand years in the past.

Statera was dancing between the two masters, keeping the Jedi on the defensive. Even when they were able to get an attack, it was quickly countered by the young padawan. His movements were on the level of Master Yoda's, precise and quick.

He ended his assault by sending the two flying across the room.

"That was Force Speed. I found it to be more refined than the techniques taught today." He said as the two Jedi reengaged him. His voice had lost a bit of its arrogant tone.

He leapt back, simultaneously pushing the two masters away from him again. He made a quick descision and sped toward Windu, attacking him before leaping away.

Windu turned to attack Statera again but was forced to retreat as Anakin started to attack him.

"Skywalker, what are you doing?" He demanded, deflecting the assaults from his supposed ally.
